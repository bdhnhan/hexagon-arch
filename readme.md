Hexagon Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture, is a design pattern used in software development. It aims to create loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment using ports and adapters. This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns and improves the maintainability and testability of the system.

## Key Concepts

### Domain
The core logic of the application. It is independent of any external systems or frameworks and contains the business rules.

### Ports
Interfaces that define the operations required or provided by the application. There are two types of ports:
- **Inbound Ports**: Define how the application can be invoked from the outside.
- **Outbound Ports**: Define how the application interacts with external systems.

### Adapters
Implementations of the ports. There are two types of adapters:
- **Inbound Adapters**: Handle external requests and invoke the appropriate inbound ports.
- **Outbound Adapters**: Implement the outbound ports to communicate with external systems.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Different parts of the application can evolve independently.
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested in isolation without relying on external systems.
- **Flexibility**: Adapters can be easily swapped to accommodate different external systems or technologies.

## Example

Consider an application that manages orders. The core domain would contain the order management logic. The inbound ports could define operations like `createOrder` and `getOrderStatus`, while the outbound ports could define operations for interacting with a payment gateway or an inventory system. The adapters would then implement these ports, allowing the application to handle HTTP requests, communicate with the payment gateway, and manage inventory.

## Conclusion

Hexagon Architecture is a powerful pattern for creating maintainable and testable software. By separating the core business logic from the external systems, it allows for greater flexibility and robustness in the design of software applications.
